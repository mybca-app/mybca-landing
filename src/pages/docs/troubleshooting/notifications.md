# Help! My notifications aren't working.

Are you not getting notifications for your buses, even after you've starred
them? Please follow these steps to troubleshoot your issue.

## iOS

1. Open "Settings", then "Apps", and then find "myBCA." Ensure that myBCA has
   permission to send notifications.
2. On the Buses page, un-star your buses, then star them again.
3. Make sure that the notifications are not being blocked by Do Not Disturb mode
   or another "Focus" mode on your device. You may want to change your Focus
   settings to allow myBCA's notifications to bypass your Focus mode.

If notifications don't work even after completing the above steps, please
contact support.
