# Frequently Asked Questions

## My club has an event. Can you add it to the in-app event calendar?

Please open the Events tab in myBCA and click the link to view the event submission form. You must log in with your school account to fill out the form. Pay close attention to the requirements stated in the form.

## How do notifications work?

Notifications are only available on our iOS and Android apps.

If you enable notifications upon first launching myBCA, notifications for your starred buses are sent every weekday at 4:10 p.m. Notifications are sent only at 4:10. If your bus has not arrived by 4:10 p.m., a new notification will not be sent; you must check the bus's location manually in the myBCA app. We intend to change this in a future update.

## What is the logo design based on?

The myBCA logo design is an outline of the main BCA building when viewed from satellite imagery.
