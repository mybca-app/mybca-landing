# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why doesn't myBCA show teacher absences?

Teacher absence information is considered private and sensitive. At this time,
we are not authorized to provide teacher absence information through myBCA, even
if we were to apply security measures to prevent the absence data from
unauthorized access.

## My club has an event. Can you add it to the in-app event calendar?

Please open the Events tab in myBCA and click the link to view the event
submission form. You must log in with your school account to fill out the form.
Pay close attention to the requirements stated in the form.

## How do notifications work?

Notifications are only available on our iOS and Android apps. In order to use
notification functionality, you must enable notifications when prompted upon
first launching myBCA.

When you have notifications enabled and one of your starred buses arrives, you
will receive a notification with its location. Our system accounts for half
days, as well as days on which your bus arrives later than 4:10 p.m.

## What is the logo design based on?

The myBCA logo design is an outline of the main BCA building when viewed from
satellite imagery.
